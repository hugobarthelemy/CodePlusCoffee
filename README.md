##Introduction

Static one page website to advertise for a friend and I services as developers.

A hosted version of **Code+Coffee** can be found [here](http://www.codepluscoffee.com/). The code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/laurage/CodePlusCoffee).

##How it was built

**Code+Coffee** is a Middleman application. It was made using Bootstrap CSS framework, SASS, jQuery, P5js, Ruby.

I used Illustrator to design its UI.

##Getting started

These steps are required in order to run the application:

1. Ruby must be installed
2. Install [Middleman 3.4](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/)
3. Run $bundle install to install the gems from the Gemfile
4. Run $middleman server and go to [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) in your browser to view the site.
